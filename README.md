## Core Components

### Models
- **Budget**: Represents a budget period with total amount, spent amount, and date range
- **Transaction**: Represents individual transactions (expenses, income, budget changes)
- **Category**: Represents expense categories for organization

### Services
- **BudgetService**: Handles budget creation, updates, and calculations
- **TransactionService**: Manages all transaction operations and analytics
- **CategoryService**: Manages expense categories
- **DatabaseManager**: Handles SQLite database operations

### Features Implementation

#### Budget Management
Similar to the original Buckwheat app's budget system:
- Set total budget amount and period
- Automatic daily budget calculation
- Smart budget redistribution when spending changes
- Progress tracking and visual indicators

#### Daily Budget Calculation
The app implements intelligent daily budget calculation:
- Initial daily budget = Total budget Ã· Total days
- Recalculation when needed = Remaining budget Ã· Remaining days
- Considers actual spending patterns and remaining time

#### Analytics Dashboard
Comprehensive analytics similar to Buckwheat:
- Budget progress with percentage and visual bars
- Spending by category with pie charts
- Daily, weekly, monthly spending analysis
- Biggest expenses and spending trends

## Technology Stack

- **Java 17**: Core programming language
- **JavaFX 19**: Modern UI framework
- **SQLite**: Local database storage
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management
- **Jackson**: JSON processing (for future features)

## Key Features Inspired by Buckwheat

1. **Smart Budget Distribution**: Like Buckwheat's intelligent daily budget recalculation
2. **Period-based Budgeting**: Set budgets for trips, months, or custom periods
3. **Visual Progress Tracking**: Color-coded progress bars and percentage indicators
4. **Category-based Organization**: Organize and analyze spending by categories
5. **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on spending and budget status

## Database Schema

### Tables
- **budgets**: Budget periods with amounts and dates
- **transactions**: All financial transactions with types and categories
- **categories**: Expense categories with colors and descriptions

### Relationships
- Transactions belong to budgets and categories
- Categories are reusable across different budgets
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

- [ ] Advanced reporting and charts
- [ ] Recurring transaction support
- [ ] Budget templates
- [ ] Dark mode theme
- [ ] Mobile companion app
- [ ] Cloud sync capabilities
